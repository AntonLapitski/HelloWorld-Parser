Hello, %USERNAME%!
I’m a simple PHP script. The first one in a sequence of %NUMBER% of tasks you’ll have to write in order to successfully complete the task.
I’ve been run at #EXECDATE#, at the first day of PHP study program. In %MONTHNUM% month(s), about #ENDDATE# the you’ll finish the mastery and even if you not find this task very easy, by that moment you probably will look at your very first script with a smile and a bit nostalgically.
I wish you a good luck.
